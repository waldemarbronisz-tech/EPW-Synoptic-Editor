// feat/editing-and-signal-panel commit 7: what a signal panel row
// actually shows once it points at a device. Mirrors MeterResolver.ts's
// own structure closely - see raport.md for what is shared between the
// two (project/DeviceLookup.ts's findDeviceById/filterDevicesByBehavior)
// and what is duplicated (this file's own resolve/dangling-rows
// functions - the actual resolution rules differ enough, per medium
// vs. per behavior, that folding them into one shared function would
// need its own behavior-specific branches anyway).
//
// Pure, Konva-free - the store's own `devices` array is passed in by
// the caller, never read from the store directly here, same convention
// as MeterResolver.ts.

 * previews ON when the device resolves - the editor has no live input/
 * closed-contact data, the same reasoning MeterResolver.ts's preview
 * value follows, just with nothing to compute (a two-state signal has
 * no "middle" to preview, so ON is the one meaningful preview state).
 * A row pointing at a device id that either does not exist, or exists
 * but is not itself SIGNAL or SWITCHED (a MEASURED or MODULATED device
 * has no notion of "closed"/"input active" to preview at all), is
 * treated as missing: QUALITY, never an exception.
