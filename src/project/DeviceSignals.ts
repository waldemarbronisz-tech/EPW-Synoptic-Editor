/**
 * Commands control logic may ISSUE to a device. Logic is entitled to
 * command any SWITCHED or MODULATED device - there is not, and must never
 * be, a field that enables or disables control from logic.
 *
 * In the EPW platform, control logic runs continuously in the runtime
 * ALONGSIDE EPW-OS. An operator command from a screen goes straight to the
 * output, bypassing logic - that is what lets the screen keep working
 * independently of the state of logic. Logic can independently issue
 * commands of its own.
 *
 * This creates a gap: logic can switch something ON, but has no way to
 * FORBID anything, and an operator command does not consult it at all -
 * an interlock authored in EPW-Logic-Studio would have no way to take
 * effect. The fix is INHIBIT signals: a device exposes inhibit points that
 * logic writes to, and EPW-OS checks them before EVERY command - its own
 * and the operator's - refusing to execute and telling the operator the
 * device is blocked.
