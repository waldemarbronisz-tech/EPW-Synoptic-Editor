// Internal-audit fix (Canvas.tsx breakup): shared between Canvas.tsx
// itself and the sub-components split out of it (ObjectNode.tsx,
// ConnectionNode.tsx) - moved verbatim, comments included.

// feat/appearance-selection-frames commit 2c: group move. Dragging ANY
// selected element, when more than one thing is selected, moves the
// WHOLE selection together, keeping relative positions, as one history
// entry - "like a graphics program", per this commit's own spec. The
// store already has exactly the right primitive for this
// (moveSelectionBy, built for arrow-key movement: skips locked
// objects, touches all four kinds atomically, one saveHistory() call);
// Canvas.tsx's own groupDrag object just drives it from a mouse drag
// too, with a live visual follow for every OTHER selected element while
// the drag is in progress.
//
// A connection's own move-Group (ConnectionNode) has no absolute x/y of
// its own - its x/y IS a pending delta from its last committed points,
// reset to (0,0) after every drag - so a connection's own "position" for
// this purpose is always (0,0), never its points' own coordinates. Every
// other kind (object/meter/signal panel) is absolute, matching its own
// x/y field directly.

  // Reports one element's own Konva node so ANOTHER element's leader
  // drag can reposition it live as a follower. Passing null
